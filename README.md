</p>

We introduce SeaLLMs - a family of language models optimized for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages. The SeaLLM-base models (to be released) were pre-trained from [Llama-2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf), on a tailored publicly-available dataset, which comprises mainly Vietnamese 🇻🇳, Indonesian 🇮🇩 and Thai 🇹🇭 texts, along with those in English 🇬🇧 and Chinese 🇨🇳. The pre-training stage involves multiple stages with dynamic data control to preserve the original knowledge base of Llama-2 while gaining new abilities in SEA languages.

The [SeaLLM-chat](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SeaLLMs/SeaLLM-Chat-13b) model underwent supervised finetuning (SFT) on a mix of public instruction data (e.g. [OpenORCA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca)) and a small number of queries used by SEA language native speakers in natural settings, which **adapt to the local cultural norms, customs, styles and laws in these areas**, as well as other SFT enhancement techniques (to be revealed later). 

Our customized SFT process helps enhance our models' ability to understand, respond, and serve communities whose languages are often neglected by previous [English-dominant LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288), while outperforming existing polyglot LLMs, like [BLOOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100) or [PolyLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06018.pdf).

Our [first released SeaLLM](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SeaLLMs/SeaLLM-Chat-13b) supports Vietnamese 🇻🇳, Indonesian 🇮🇩, and Thai 🇹🇭. Future versions endeavor to cover all languages spoken in Southeast Asia.

The following sections summarize the [Pre-training](#pre-training), [Supervised-Finetuning (SFT)](#supervised-finetuning-sft) and [performance evaluations](#evaluation).

## Pre-training

### Vocabulary Expansion
Like many English/Latin-dominant LLMs, Llama-2's BPE tokenizer breaks non-European and non-Latin linguistic texts into unsustainably long byte-level sequences that cover much shorter semantic meanings, leading to [degraded performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11372). For instance, it takes 4.3x more tokens to encode the same sentence in Thai compared to that in English (see below table). This leads to the models failing to perform tasks requiring long context modeling (e.g., summarization and comprehension tasks) without exceeding the context length.

Our goal for vocabulary expansion is threefold: (1) the number of newly-added tokens must be minimal and only cover the new languages, (2) the tokens should bring the compression ratios of new languages close to that of English, and (3) minimize the disruption of existing European tokens to preserve Llama-2 knowledge. In the end, we obtain **~11K** new tokens for Vi, Id, Th, and Zh to augment the original 32000-token vocabulary. Details of our expansion technique will be revealed in our upcoming technical report.

As seen in the table below, our new vocabulary reduces the compression ratio from 4.29 to 1.57 for Thai - meaning it can now encode 2.7x longer Thai text given the same context length. Meanwhile, English is only compressed by 0.3%, thus preserving its integrity.

|Language | ChatGPT's ratio | Llama's ratio | Our ratio | # New tokens
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vi | 4.41 | 2.91 | 1.2488 | 2304
| Zh | 2.80 | 1.99 | 1.1806 | 3456
| Th | 9.09 | 4.29 | 1.5739 | 1536
| Id | 2.00 | 1.76 | 1.1408 | 3840
| En | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.9976 | ---


### Pre-training Data

The pre-training dataset of SeaLLMs is formed by the documents from diverse public sources, including web texts (e.g., [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/)), 
news documents (e.g., [CC-News](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cc_news)), academic articles, and texts with expert knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia). 
We firstly employ [FastText language indentifier](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) to filter out the documents that do not belong to Thai, Vietnamese or Indonesian. 
To further remove harmful or undesirable content, we develop a pipeline with various data cleaning and filtering modules to preprocess the collected data. 
Meanwhile, to maintain the English performance of SeaLLMs, we also introduce a set of high-quality English texts sampled from [RedPajama-Data](https://github.com/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data) into pre-training. 

### Pre-training Strategies

We conduct pre-training in 4 different stages. Each stage serves a different specific objective and involves dynamic control of (unsupervised and supervised) data mixture, as well as data specification and categorization. We also employ novel sequence construction and masking techniques during these stages. More details are to be provided in the technical report.

As our goal is for Llama-2 to learn new languages with the least number of tokens and computing resources, we control an appropriate data mix of new (Vi, Id & Th) and old (En, Zh) languages so that the new vocabulary and knowledge are trained quickly, while relatively maintaining the performance of the original Llama-2 model and establishing a knowledge bridge between new and existing languages.

We pre-train our SeaLLM-base in ~4 weeks on 32gpus, clocking ~150B tokens. We use [Flash-attention-V2](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) as well as fusing many operations to achieve greater training throughput.

## Supervised Finetuning (SFT)

### SFT Data

Our supervised finetuning (SFT) data consists of many categories. The largest of them are public and open-source, such as [OpenORCA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca) and [Platypus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/garage-bAInd/Open-Platypus). As the aforementioned are English only, we employ several established or novel automatic techniques to gather more instruction data for SEA languages. 

Even more noteworthy is that we engaged native speakers to collect a small number of queries used by SEA-language native speakers in natural settings, which helps in adaptation to the local cultural customs, norms, and laws. We also collect country-relevant safety data that cover many culturally and legally sensitive topics in each of these SEA countries - such data tend to be ignored, or may even appear in conflict with Western safety data. Therefore, we believe that our models are more local-friendly and abide by local rules to a higher degree.

### SFT Strategies

We conduct SFT with a relatively balanced mix of SFT data from different categories. We make use of the system prompt during training, as we found it helps induce a prior which conditions the model to a behavioral distribution that focuses on safety and usefulness. More details will be provided in the technical report.


## Evaluation



### Safety Enchancement in Local Context

There is growing [evidence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06474.pdf) that western-built LLMs often neglect safety protection in many lower-resource languages, or even promote contents that may be locally perceived as harmful, inappropriate or illegal by local norms and laws. We take efforts in adapting and safeguarding our SeaLLM models to achieve greater adoption and compliance for the regional audience of Southeast Asia.

The below dropdown table showcases examples of potentially harmful content that ChatGPT generates whereas our model behaves safer and complies with the regulations.

<details>
<summary><span style="color: red">WARNING:</span> The dropdown will display potentially harmful content.</summary>
<br>

### Peer Comparison

One of the most reliable ways to compare chatbot models is peer comparison. 
With the help of native speakers, we built an instruction test set that focuses on various aspects expected in a user-facing chatbot, namely:
(1) task-solving (e.g. translation & comprehension), 
(2) math-reasoning (e.g., math and logical reasoning questions), 
(3) general-instruction (e.g., instructions in general domains),
(4) natural-questions (e.g., questions about local context often written informally), and
(5) safety-related questions.
The test set also covers all languages that we are concerned with.
We use **GPT-4** as an evaluator to rate the comparison between our models versus ChatGPT-3.5 and other baselines.

Compared with [PolyLM-13b-chat](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06018.pdf), a recent multilingual model, our model significantly outperforms across all languages and categories.


<div class="row" style="display: flex; clear: both;">
    <img src="seallm_vs_polylm_by_lang.png" alt="Snow" style="float: left; width: 48%">
    <img src="seallm_vs_polylm_by_cat_sea.png" alt="Forest" style="float: left; width: 48%">
</div>

Compared with Llama-2-13b-chat, our SeaLLM-13b performs significantly better in all SEA languages, 
despite the fact that Llama-2 was already trained on a decent data amount of Vi, Id, and Th.
In English, our model is 46% as good as Llama-2-13b-chat, even though it did not undergo complex human-labor intensive RLHF.



<div class="row" style="display: flex; clear: both;">

  <img src="seallm_vs_llama2_by_cat_sea.png" alt="Forest" style="float: left; width: 48%">
</div>

Compared with ChatGPT-3.5, our SeaLLM-13b model is performing 45% as good as ChatGPT for Thai. 
For important aspects such as Safety and Task-Solving, our model is nearly on par with ChatGPT across the languages. 
Note that using **GPT-4** to evaluate ChatGPT-3.5 can also be tricky not only for safety aspects because they likely follow a similar training strategy with similar data.

<div class="row" style="display: flex; clear: both;">

  <img src="seallm_vs_chatgpt_by_cat_sea.png" alt="Forest" style="float: left; width: 48%">
</div>

As **GPT-4**, which was built for global use, may not consider certain safety-related responses as harmful or sensitive in the local context, 
while certain sensitive topics may entail conflicting and controversial opinions across cultures.
We engage native linguists to rate and compare SeaLLM's and ChatGPT responses to a natural and local-aware safety test set.
The linguists choose a winner or a tie in a totally randomized and double-blind manner, which means both we and the linguists do not know the responses' origins.

As shown in human evaluation below, SeaLLM is tie with ChatGPT in most cases, while outperforming ChatGPT for Vi and Th.

| Safety Human Eval | Id | Th | Vi | Avg
|-----------| ------- | ------- |  ------- | ------- 
| SeaLLM-13b Win | 12.09% | 23.40% | 8.42% | 14.64%
| Tie            | 65.93% | 67.02% | 89.47% | 74.29%
| ChatGPT Win    | 21.98% | 9.57% | 2.11% | 11.07%

### M3Exam - World Knowledge in Regional Languages


[M3Exam](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05179.pdf) is a collection of real-life and native official human exam question benchmarks. This benchmark covers questions from multiple countries in the SEA region, which require strong multilingual proficiency and cultural knowledge across various critical educational periods, from primary- to high-school levels of difficulty.

As shown in the table, our SeaLLM model outperforms most 13B baselines and reaches closer to ChatGPT's performance. 
Notably, for Thai - a seemingly low-resource language, our model is just 1% behind ChatGPT despite the large size difference.


| M3Exam / 3-shot (Acc) | En | Zh | Vi | Id | Th
|-----------| ------- | ------- |  ------- | ------- | ------- | 
| Random                | <span style="color: gray">25.00</span> | <span style="color: gray">25.00</span> | <span style="color: gray">25.00</span> | <span style="color: gray">23.00</span> | <span style="color: gray">23.00</span>
| ChatGPT               | 75.46 | 60.20 | 58.64 | 49.27 | 37.41
|-----------| ------- | ------- |  ------- | ------- | -------
| Llama-2-13b           | 59.88 | 43.40 | 41.70 | 34.80 | 23.18
| [Llama-2-13b-chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf)      | 61.17 | 43.29 | 39.97 | 35.50 | 23.74
| [Polylm-13b-chat](https://huggingface.co/DAMO-NLP-MT/polylm-chat-13b)       | 32.23 | 29.26 | 29.01 | 25.36 | 18.08
| SeaLLM-13b-chat       | **63.53** | **46.31** | **49.25** | **40.61** | **36.30**


### MMLU - Preserving English-based knowledge

On the 5-shot [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300), our SeaLLM models not only preserve but also slightly outperform 13B LLama-2 and Llama-2-chat, despite the fact that optimizing for this English dominant test set is not part of our goal.

| MMLU (Acc) | STEM | Humanities | Social | Others | Average
|-----------| ------- | ------- |  ------- | ------- | ------- | 
| Llama-2-13b       | 44.1 | 52.8 | 62.6 | 61.1 | 54.8
| Llama-2-13b-chat  | 43.7 | 49.3 | 62.6 | 60.1 | 53.5
| SeaLLM-13b-chat   | 43.4 | **53.0** | **63.3** | **61.4** | **55.1**


### NLP tasks

We also test our models on many different NLP tasks.

#### Reading Comprehension (XQUAD & IndoQA)

[XQUAD](https://github.com/google-deepmind/xquad) is a popular multilingual variant of [SQUAD](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1264/) benchmark, which evaluates models on reading comprehension ability. As XQUAD does not support Indonesian, we substitute it with [IndoQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jakartaresearch/indoqa), which was created for the same purpose.

As shown in the table below, the 1-shot reading comprehension performance is significantly better than Llama-2 for the SEA languages, while preserving the high performance in existing languages (En & Zh).

| XQUAD/IndoQA (F1) | En | Zh | Vi | Id | Th | ALL | SEA-lang
|-----------| ------- | ------- |  ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | 
| Llama-2-13b       | **83.22** | **78.02** | 71.03 | 59.31 | 30.73 | 64.46 | 59.77
| Llama-2-13b-chat  | 80.46 | 70.54 | 62.87 | 63.05 | 25.73 | 60.93 | 51.21
| SeaLLM-13b-chat   | 75.23 | 75.65 | **72.86** | **64.37** | **61.37** | **69.90**	| **66.20**


#### Translation

For translation tasks, we evaluate our models with the [FloRes-200](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores/blob/main/flores200/README.md) using [chrF++](https://aclanthology.org/W15-3049/) scores in 4-shot settings.

Similarly observed, our SeaLLM model outperforms Llama-2 significantly in the new languages.


| FloRes-200 (chrF++) | En-Zh | En-Vi | En-Id | En-Th | En->X | Zh-En | Vi-En | Id-En | Th-En | X->En
|-------- | ---- | ---- |  ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Llama-2-13b       | **24.36** | 53.20 | 60.41 | 22.16 | 45.26 | 53.20 | 59.10 | 63.42 | 38.48 | 53.55
| Llama-2-13b-chat  | 19.58 | 51.70 | 57.14 | 21.18 | 37.40 | 52.27 | 54.32 | 60.55 | 30.18 | 49.33
| SeaLLM-13b-chat   | 23.12 | **59.00** | **66.16** | **43.33** | **47.91** | **53.67** | **60.93** | **65.66** | **57.39** | **59.42**

Our models are also performing competitively with ChatGPT for translation between SEA languages without English pivoting.

| FloRes-200 (chrF++) | Vi-Id | Id-Vi | Vi-Th | Th-Vi | Id-Th | Th-Id
|-------- | ---- | ---- |  ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| ChatGPT                     | 56.75 | 54.17 | 40.48 | 46.54 | 40.59 | 51.87
| SeaLLM-13b-chat             | 53.77 | 53.60 | 30.74 | 49.09 | 36.96 | 48.73

#### Summarization

Lastly, in 2-shot [XL-sum summarization tasks](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.413/), our model also achieves better performance, with substantial gains in Thai.

| XL-Sum (rouge-L) | En | Zh | Vi | Id | Th
|-------- | ---- | ---- |  ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Llama-2-13b        | 32.57 | 34.37 | 18.61 | 25.14 | 16.91
| Llama-2-13b-chat   | 25.11 | 31.13 | 18.29 | 22.45 | 17.51
| SeaLLM-13b-chat    | 26.88 | 33.39 | 19.39 | 25.96 | 21.37
